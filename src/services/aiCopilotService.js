 * AI Copilot Service — Phase 1 (AI Chat API)
 *
 * Orchestrates: classify intent -> call EXISTING analytics services/models
 * (never a raw ad-hoc query built from user input, never new business
 * logic/formulas) -> merge results into one structured JSON object -> build
 * a prompt via the existing promptBuilder -> call the existing AI Gateway ->
 * return a normalized answer. The LLM never sees a table/column name, never
 * receives DB credentials, and never generates SQL — it only receives the
 * plain JSON objects below, exactly as dashboardService/reportService
 * already shape them for every other consumer in this app.
 *
 * Only intents backed by an existing, already-correct calculation are
 * "supported" here. Forecast/Recommendation(skill-match)/Project Health
 * (score)/What-If have no existing methodology anywhere in this codebase to
 * reuse — see aiCopilotIntent.js's UNSUPPORTED_INTENT_KEYWORDS — so instead
 * of inventing a formula and presenting it as the backend's calculation,
 * this returns an explicit "not available yet" response for those without
 * calling the AI Gateway at all.
