 *                       Employee and must appear in Employee Master like
 *                       anyone else), plus Employees they directly created,
 *                       plus every Employee in a Company
 *                       under an Entity they own (transitively, via Entity

 *                       second, unrelated Admin account never sees the
 *                       first Admin's Employees.
 *   3 Entity Admin    - scoped to Companies under Entities they own.
 *   4 BU Admin        - scoped to their own Company.
 *   5 Project Admin   - scoped to their own Company (no Project Admin ->
 *                       Project Manager/Employee mapping table exists yet
 *                       to narrow this further — see the doc comment below).
 *   6 Project Manager- their own Employee record, plus every Employee
 *                       mapped to a Team Lead on their team (team_mappings).
 *   7 Team Lead       - their own Employee record, plus every Employee
 *                       mapped to them (manager_employee_mappings; renamed
 *                       from "Manager" — 20260897_rename_manager_role_to_
 *                       team_lead.sql — same role_id/tables/columns).
 *   8 Employee        - their own Employee record only.
 *   HR (no rank)      - scoped to their own Company.
 *
 * Team Lead/Project Manager scope is resolved the same DATA-DRIVEN way
 * resolveEmployeeScope() (timesheetApprovalReportService.js) and
 * assertOwnEmployee() (managerSelfServiceService.js) already do: whoever
 * the mapping tables say is a Team Lead/Project Manager for an Employee gets
 * that access, regardless of their role name/rank — a User's PRIMARY role
 * can be anything and they can still hold a Secondary Team Lead mapping (a
 * real, already-seen case). This is computed unconditionally for every
 * caller below their own tier, not gated behind a role-name check, so it
 * also naturally covers a caller who holds Team Lead/Project Manager as an
 * ADDITIONAL operational role (see database/migrations/
 * 20260850_add_user_additional_roles.sql) on top of a different primary
 * role — the union-of-roles behavior required for multi-role accounts.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP (documented, not invented around): Project Admin and BU Admin
 * both have a `*.view_mapped_employees` capability seeded in
 * role_capabilities, implying an intended narrower-than-company-wide scope,
 * but no mapping table backing either capability exists in the schema
 * today (only Team Lead -> Employee and Project Manager -> Team Lead do).
 * Falling back to company-wide for these two tiers is the tightest bound
 * the EXISTING schema supports without inventing a new mapping table; it
 * still closes the reported cross-company/ID-guessing vulnerability. A
 * true fix for the finer-grained restriction needs a real Project
 * Admin/BU Admin employee-mapping table first.
