 * resolvers already in this codebase before this module existed. This
 * service deliberately uses the SAME resolver Employee Master and the Work

 * manager_employee_mappings-only resolver the My-Team/Approval modules use,

 * employee's PRIMARY manager to their immediate Team Lead, not the Project
 * Manager two levels up).
 *
 * resolveTeamEmployeeIds() below is copied (not imported) from
 * employeeWorkLogComplianceService.js's own resolveAuthorizedEmployeeIds,
 * per that file's stated rationale: keep each service self-contained rather
 * than create an implicit cross-service coupling that could break if that
 * service is ever refactored.
 *
 * Service PO / Project / Client visibility is scoped by `companyIds` alone
 * (the caller's Business-Unit reach, resolved by resolveReportCompanyScope
 * middleware) — the same BU-wide convention every report in
 * managementReportRepository.js already uses, NOT the stricter
 * "individually-mapped Service POs only" rule servicePOService.getAll()
 * applies to the Service PO Master screen. See pmDashboardRepository.js's
