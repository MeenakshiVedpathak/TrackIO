 * explicit list of Company ids instead, scoped to that specific Admin/
 * Entity Admin's OWN sub-hierarchy, never every Company on the platform.
 * Extracted here so every resource applies the SAME scope — the same bug
 * (an unrelated second Admin seeing the first Admin's data) was found
 * independently in employeeAccessControlService.js and clientService.js;
 * this stops it from having to be independently re-fixed a third time.
 *
 * - Admin (rank 2): every Company under an Entity they own, transitively —
 *   via Entities they created directly (entities.created_by = adminEmployeeId)
 *   OR via Entity Admins they created (entities.entity_admin_employee_id ->
 *   employees.created_by = adminEmployeeId). See
 *   entityRepository.findIdsOwnedByAdmin for the exact query.
 * - Entity Admin (rank 3): every Company under an Entity THEY directly own
 *   (entities.entity_admin_employee_id = their own employeeId).
 * - Any other rank: not applicable — returns `null` (that actor has their
 *   own single `req.companyId` instead; callers should use that, not this).
 *
 * @param {number|null} hierarchyRank
 * @param {number|null} employeeId
 * @returns {Promise<number[]|null>} array of Company ids (possibly empty —
 *   means "owns nothing yet", not "unrestricted"), or `null` if this rank
