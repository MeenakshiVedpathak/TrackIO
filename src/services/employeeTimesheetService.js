/**
 * ADD one or more Start Time/End Time segments to a Module/Task's entry for

 * sends; this is genuinely ADDITIVE — a caller adding a second segment
 * later in the day (or in a whole separate session) never needs to resend
 * the segments already saved earlier. That's the whole reason this exists
 * as its own operation: e.g. Module M1 logged 01:00-02:00 earlier, Task T1
 * logged 03:00-04:00 earlier, then a later call adds T1 04:00-06:00 — M1
 * stays at its own 1h total, T1 becomes 1h + 2h = 3h. Neither call's
 * segments are ever silently dropped by the other.
 *
 * Find-or-create the (employee, service_po_id, hierarchy_node_id,
 * work_date) row: if it doesn't exist yet, this call creates it (like a
 * single-line replaceDailyEntries) and `description` is required; if it
 * already exists, only the NEW segments are inserted (old ones are left
 * completely untouched in the DB — never deleted-and-reinserted), `hours`
 * is recomputed as old total + new segments' total, and `description` is
 * only changed if explicitly supplied.
 *
 * Overlap is checked across the COMBINED set (already-saved + new) — a new
 * segment overlapping one saved by an earlier call is rejected, not
 * silently allowed just because it wasn't part of THIS request.
