 *       entirely client-side, then sends ONLY the resulting Microsoft ID
 *       token here. Multi-tenant: a work/school account from ANY Microsoft
 *       Entra tenant can present a token. The backend verifies its signature
 *       (against Microsoft's tenant-independent JWKS), audience, expiration,
 *       and issuer against the token's own tenant ID, and requires the
 *       email's domain to be verified in that tenant, before trusting any
 *       claim from it — email/name/role are never accepted from the request
 *       body itself. Employee Master decides who may log in.
 *
 *       Once the verified email resolves to an existing Employee, behavior
 *       is IDENTICAL to POST /auth/login from that point on: an Employee
 *       holding exactly ONE active role logs in directly; an Employee

 *     summary: Switch the authenticated employee's active role, without logging out
 *     description: |
 *       For an employee holding MULTIPLE active roles (e.g. Admin and BU
 *       Admin): switches the active role of the CURRENT session to another
 *       one of their own currently-active roles, and issues a fresh
 *       access/refresh token pair scoped to it — same session architecture
 *       as POST /auth/login and POST /auth/select-role, just triggered from
 *       an already-authenticated request instead of a pre-auth
 *       `loginTicket`. The employee is resolved from the caller's own
 *       Bearer access token, never from the request body, and `roleId`
 *       is validated server-side against THIS employee's own active roles
 *       — requesting a role not assigned to the caller, or no longer
 *       active, is rejected with 403. The prior session/refresh token is
 *       NOT revoked by a role switch (same as select-role); it simply
 *       expires or is revoked separately via /auth/logout.
 *
 *       BU (Business Unit) mapping is completely unaffected by a role
 *       switch — existing BU authorization/selection behavior for the new
 *       active role applies unchanged, same as any other login.

 *       entirely from the Bearer access token — a User access token or an
 *       Employee access token are both accepted here (they are distinguished
 *       by JWT audience), and whichever one is presented determines which
 *       table gets updated. Any `id`/`userType` sent in the request body is
 *       ignored; only the authenticated token's own identity is ever used,
 *       so an account can only ever change its own password.
