/**
 * Cross-BU Employee & Service PO Hours Report — raw SQL over employee_work_logs
 * (the same source the Project-Wise Timesheet / Work Log Hours Summary reports
 * use: it carries the Service PO hierarchy node and the approval status),
 * never the official `timesheets` table. Read-only.
 *
 * Employee BU and PO BU are two INDEPENDENT dimensions and nothing here ever
 * collapses them into one filter:
 *   Employee BU / Sub-BU  <- employee_business_units (active rows; the legacy
 *                            employees.company_id only when an employee has no
 *                            membership at all)
 *   PO BU                 <- service_pos.company_id
 * A Sub-BU rolls up to its Parent BU (companies.parent_business_unit_id) for
 * the Own/Cross comparison, so a Sub-BU employee working on a Parent-level PO
 * of the same BU family is Own BU work.
 *
 * Work type, derived per row:
 *   own  — the PO's BU is one of the employee's BUs
 *   cross — the PO has a BU and the employee has BUs, but it is none of them
 *   na   — not classifiable: Centralised PO (Leave/Bench/...), a PO with no BU,
 *          or an employee with no BU. Never silently dropped.
 *
 * One output row = Employee + Service PO + month (total hours on that PO; the Service PO's
 * Activity/Task hierarchy is deliberately NOT part of this report).
