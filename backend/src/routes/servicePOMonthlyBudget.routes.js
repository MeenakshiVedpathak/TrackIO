 *         - ?year=2026 -> every record in 2026 the caller's role can see

 *       a records array (month is null when not filtered; each record still
 *       carries its own month for grouping). With service_po_id, response
 *       is that single record.
 *       service_po_id (when given) is validated against the authenticated
 *       caller's role scope from the JWT (never trusted as-is): a Manager
 *       passing a service_po_id outside their own mapped scope gets 404,
 *       identical to a genuinely missing or another company's PO — this
 *       never reveals whether the PO exists outside their scope. Other
 *       roles (e.g. BU Admin, Project Manager) are unrestricted beyond
 *       their own company/BU. When service_po_id is omitted, the list is
 *       narrowed the same way (Manager: only their mapped POs' records).
