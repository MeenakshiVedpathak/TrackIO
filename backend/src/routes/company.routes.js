/**

 * legitimately needs to load THEIR OWN mapped BUs here too, without gaining
 * Entity Admin's "every company under my owned Entities" scope. Delegates
 * unchanged to requireEntityAdminOrAdmin for Admin/Entity Admin; for a BU
 * Admin (rank 4), Project Admin (rank 5), or Project Manager (rank 6) with
 * at least one active mapped BU, sets req.employeeBUsOnly so
 * companyController.getAll returns their own mapped BUs instead — the same
 * BU-filter dropdown the PM Dashboard screen needs (see the PM Dashboard
 * capability gate in pmDashboard.routes.js, which grants those same two
 * ranks access to that module). Anyone else (including a 0-BU actor at any
 * of these three ranks) is rejected exactly as before.
 *
 * Uses authenticate.authenticateIdentity (not the default authenticate)
 * because resolveCompany is irrelevant to both branches here (Entity Admin/
 * Admin's scope comes from req.entityIds, not req.companyId; a BU-mapped
 * actor's own mapped BUs come straight from req.employeeBusinessUnits) and a
 * multi-BU actor must be able to load this dropdown BEFORE they have picked
 * an active BU to put in X-Company-Id — the same bootstrap requirement as
 * GET /employees/:id/business-units.
