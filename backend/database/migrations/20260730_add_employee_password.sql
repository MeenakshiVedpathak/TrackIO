-- Employee Self Timesheet — Phase 1: give Employees a password column so they
-- can authenticate through the same /auth/login endpoint as Users. Nullable
-- (an Employee with no password set simply cannot log in yet, until an Admin
-- provisions one via POST/PUT /employees or PUT /employees/:id/reset-password).
-- Safe to re-run.

-- it only existed on already-migrated databases because it was added
-- out-of-band at some point. Add it here for real so a brand-new environment
-- ends up with it too, matching src/models/Employee.js's field definition.
